<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Project Name MS_Cygnus</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>:
Basically people can play with this program using keyboard on the computer. People will be able to control a character to shoot the boss monster(AI) that moves around the screen, but also has several phases to attack the player.
<strong>Description</strong>:
This program is motivated from an actual online game called MapleStory. Last semester, I made a program based on MapleStory, however, it wasn't really satisfying because there weren't a lot of functions in the code. On this project, I will add a lot more functions that I learned during the second semester to make it more creative and fun.
<h2>Timeline</h2>

  <h3>Milestone #1: April 25th, 2015 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Even if it is not complete, make sure to finish most of the functions in the Player part of the code.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : Create/Add images that I will using for the player's character using a website called BannedStory.</li>
    <li>second task : create a class Player and put codes to make a character to use in the game.</li>
    <li>third task : for sure, there will be a lot of bug fixes.</li>
  </ul>
